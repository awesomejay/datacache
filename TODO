# Create option for return=bin.  By default it replaces "-" and ":" with spaces
and writes IEEE 64-bit LE Floating Point numbers.  Add recordsPerLine in JSON
output and numberOfRecords.

# Allow input of time2info(line) that returns [timeInteger,timeUnit,ISO 8601
Time] when time integer is computed from timeZero. Use this to compute
startTime, stopTime, timeUnit for each granule.

# Create option for return=binmeta.  Return startTime, stopTime, timeUnit
(smallest in all files), recordsPerLine, numberOfRecords, responseSize, and
meta, and metaJSON if it exists.

# Allow option of input of timeFormat %Y %m %d, etc..  Use this to add startTime
and stopTime to JSON.

# If time stamps are not fractional (%Y [%m %d %h %m %s]), compute required
timeUnit to preserve timestamps when converted to integers.

# If return=bin and timeFormat is given time to ms.  If timeUnit is given,
convert time to time since start.  When streaming, will need to correct times by
finding smallest time unit.

# If return=binmeta return startTime, stopTime, timeUnit, recordsPerLine,
numberOfRecords, responseSize, and meta, and metaJSON if it exists.
